   - Refer to `players/random.py` and `players/greedy.py` for examples.

2. **Configure the Game:**
   - Open `config.py` and set the players who will compete and the number of games (`num_games`).

3. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute `python3.12 run.py` to simulate the games and display results.

## Submission

   - **Important:**
     - Do **not** change the class name (`SubmissionPlayer`).
     - Avoid print statements.
     - Keep the provided execution code unchanged.

2. **Debugging:**
   - Use `logging.debug()` statements to output debug information to `debug.log`.
